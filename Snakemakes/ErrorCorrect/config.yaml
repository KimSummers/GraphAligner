### Misc params. Defaults might work

# k for error correcting the reads. Try between 10-30
SmallK: 11
# k for the de Bruijn graph. Try between ~1/2 and ~2/3 of short read length
BigK: 61
# minimum k-mer abundance for the de Bruijn graph. Try around ~1/100 of short read coverage, but not below 2.
Abundance: 2
